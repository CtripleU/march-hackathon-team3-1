New York’s three main indexes enjoyed gains after data showed US unemployment claims last week came in below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic emerged early last year, reinforcing hope that the world’s top economy is on the mend.

In Asia, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Mumbai and Taipei each added more than one percent.

On Thursday, US President Joe Biden gave his first news conference and promised that 200 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine would be administered in his first 100 days.</p>
